# Bazzite ships /opt as a symlink into /var/opt (the older FCOS-style
# pattern). That caused two separate problems: a build-time cpio error when
# installing RPMs that target /opt (Brave, Mullvad, etc.), and - more
# seriously - content written there gets silently DISCARDED on real
# deployments, because ostree treats /var like a Docker volume: it's only
# populated from the image when the machine's stateroot /var is still
# empty, and once it isn't, existing files are never overwritten by a
# newer image. That's why Brave installed cleanly at build time but ended
# up with nothing in /opt after actually switching to the image.
#
# Fix (bootc's own documented approach for base images that want /opt
# content to "just work" from a derived build): make /opt a real directory
# instead of a symlink, so anything installed there becomes part of the
# immutable, properly-versioned root filesystem - same as /usr - rather
# than machine-local persistent state.
rm -f /opt && mkdir -p /opt
